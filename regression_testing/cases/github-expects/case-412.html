  <title>Issue 412 - Warnings for Quotes</title>
  <style type="text/css">
  a.c1 {generic_style}
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This issue ensures that the fix properly warns for the
  following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <kbd>style</kbd> attribute in the paragraph tag has
    three closing quotes, and the <kbd>name</kbd> has an extra
    closing quote. This should generate a warning for each extra
    quote (todo: only warn once, and indicate the name of the
    attribute).</li>
    <li>Both <kbd>is</kbd> and <kbd>id</kbd> should report missing
    quotes.</li>
    <li>Tidy will not notice that the value for <kbd>id</kbd> is
    "midnight shows", and will create a new attribute called
    <kbd>shows</kbd>, which is reported as being proprietary.</li>
  </ul><a class="myclass c1"
        href="http://example.com"
        is="some-thing&quot;"
        id="midnight"
        shows=""
        title="cool">You are cool.</a>
