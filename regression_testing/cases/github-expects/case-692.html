<!--
This test case represents HTML Tidy issue #692, which describes
how Tidy misbehaves when there are multiple <title> elements present.
The reason this change is needed is to alert the user that multiple
<title> elements are present, and to deleted all but the first title
element, which is consistent with the behavior of mainline web browers
as of this commit date.
