      About this case
    </h1>
    <p>
      This test case ensures that Tidy handles autonomous custom tags appropriately for pre-HTML5 documents. Tidy will support them via the <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> option, even though such documents do not support such tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>no</strong>, and so Tidy should report unknown tags. We will use <kbd>force-output</kbd> to ensure that a document is generated, and to gather additional warning output.
    </p>
    <pizzerias>
      This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it.

    <jets-pizza>
      This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it. Because <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>no</strong>, it's treated like any other user-defined tag, even though it looks like an autonomous custom tag.
    </jets-pizza>This is an autonomous custom tag, but it's not supported in this test case. It should be rejected and cause an error.
