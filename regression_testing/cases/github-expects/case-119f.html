      About this case
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this case, <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>blocklevel</strong>, and so Tidy should output them as blocklevel elements instead of inline.
    </p>
    <dominos-pizza>
      This is an autonomous custom tag,
    </dominos-pizza>, and it should show up as a blocklevel element,
    <new-blocklevel-element>
      as does this.
    </new-blocklevel-element>.
