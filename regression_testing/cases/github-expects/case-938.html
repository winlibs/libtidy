<!--
This test case represents HTML Tidy issue #839, which describes
a descrepancy between tidy's behavior and the W3C Nu HTML
checker behavior. Tidy has historically allowed empty <title>
elements, but this is not allowed by HTML5, and is flagged by
the Nu checker. Because a <title> is required by HTML5, it
would be even worse for HTML Tidy to remove this element, and
so Tidy will now provide a warning if the title element is
empty. It is assumed the HTML author will add a title as well
as addressing other warnings.
