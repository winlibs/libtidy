      Issue #119 - Test HTML4, custom-tags: inline

      About this case
    </h1>
    <p>
      This test case ensures that Tidy handles autonomous custom tags appropriately for pre-HTML5 documents. Tidy will support them via the <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> option, even though such documents do not support such tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>inline</strong>, and so Tidy should allow them, and treat them as inline. However because this is not an HTML5 document, Tidy will report warnings about their use.
    </p>
    <pizzerias>
      This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it.
    </pizzerias>
    <jets-pizza>
      This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it. Even though <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>inline</strong>, this tag is configured as <strong>blocklevel</strong> in the configuration, and so will be treated as such.
    </jets-pizza>
    <p>
      <dominos-pizza>This is an autonomous custom tag,</dominos-pizza>, and it should show up as an inline element, <new-inline-element>as does this.</new-inline-element>.
