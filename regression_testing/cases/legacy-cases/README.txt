About this test suite:
======================

These test files represent that standard regression testing that must be
performed prior to committing changes to Tidy's code. In some circumstances
results are platform specific and these notices will be displayed in the
testing results.

Most of these tests date back to HTML Tidy’s origin on Sourceforge, and the
test case base names reflect the Sourceforge bug number. This isn’t always
true, though, and someone can probably go through the commit history to
see what’s been added since then.

In any case, it’s best not to add new tests to this directory.
