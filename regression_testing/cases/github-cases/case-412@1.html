<title>Issue 412 - Warnings for Quotes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This issue ensures that the fix properly warns for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The <kbd>style</kbd> attribute in the paragraph tag has three closing quotes,
  and the <kbd>name</kbd> has an extra closing quote. This should generate a
  warning for each extra quote (todo: only warn once, and indicate the name of 
  the attribute).
</li>
<li>
  Both <kbd>is</kbd> and <kbd>id</kbd> should report missing quotes.
</li>
<li>
  Tidy will not notice that the value for <kbd>id</kbd> is "midnight shows",
  and will create a new attribute called <kbd>shows</kbd>, which is reported as
  being proprietary.
</li>
</ul>
<a style="generic_style""" class="myclass" href="http://example.com"" is=some-thing" id=midnight shows title="cool">You are cool.</a>
