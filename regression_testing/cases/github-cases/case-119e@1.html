<title>Issue #119 - Test HTML5, custom-tags: inline</title>
<body>
<h1>About this case</h1>
<p>
This test case ensures that Tidy handles autonomous custom tags appropriately
for HTML5 documents.
</p>
<p>
In this case, <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>inline</strong>, and so Tidy
should accept unknown tags if they look like autonomous custom elements.
</p>

<pizzerias>
  This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it.
</pizzerias>

<jets-pizza>
  This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should not provide a warning.
  Even though <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>inline</strong>, this tag is
  configured as <strong>blocklevel</strong> in the configuration, and so will
  be treated as such.
</jets-pizza>

<p>
<dominos-pizza>This is an autonomous custom tag,</dominos-pizza>, and it should
show up as an inline element, 
<new-inline-element>as does this.</new-inline-element>.
