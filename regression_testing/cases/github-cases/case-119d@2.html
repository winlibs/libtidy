<title>Issue #119 - Test HTML5, custom-tags: no</title>
<body>
<h1>About this case</h1>
<p>
This test case ensures that Tidy handles autonomous custom tags appropriately
for HTML5 documents.
</p>
<p>
In this case, <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>no</strong>, and so Tidy should
report unknown tags. We will use <kbd>force-output</kbd> to ensure that a
document is generated, and to gather additional warning output.
</p>

<pizzerias>
  This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should provide a warning, but allow it.
  The warning is issued because although being a user-defined tag, there's
  nothing in the specification that allows such a tag that we know about.
</pizzerias>

<jets-pizza>
  This is a user-defined tag, and Tidy should <em>not</em> provide a warning.
  Although <kbd>custom-tags</kbd> is <strong>no</strong>, it looks like an
  autonomous custom tag, and the user defined it, and so there's no reason to
  warn about it.
</jets-pizza>

<dominos-pizza>
  This is an autonomous custom tag, but it's not supported in this test case.
  It should be rejected and cause an error.
